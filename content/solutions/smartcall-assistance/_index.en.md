- title: Customer Identification
  text: Customer identification is the process of verifying the identity of the person
    calling your contact centre. By checking the authorisation via Conversational
    AI, the assistant can prepare the call for the human agent. Or authorize the customer
    for self-service. This will save a huge amount of time without sacrifising customer
    satisfaction. Ally can verify a caller's identity through your CRM system using
    their phone number and personal details such as date of birth or postal code.
    Once the identity and intent of the caller are clear, the assistant can proceed
    to either fulfil or route the call.

- title: Call Routing
  text: Based on the customer’s input, Ally connects the customer to the right department
    and even best agent for their unique question. This can be based on variables
    such as waiting times, a preference to talk to the same person they previously
    spoke to, or specific subject matter knowledge of the agent. No matter who the
    call is routed to, Ally is the ideal colleague and will always hand over the call
    with all information ready to go.

- title: Call Handling
  text: Call Handling offers clients the ability to self-service, giving them the
    opportunity to solve problems on-demand; also outside office hours. By starting
    the conversation with the open question ‘How can I help you?’, clients can converse
    with Ally in a natural way. Call Handling thus reduces call volume and allows
    agents in contact centres to stop spending time on simple, repetitive questions.
    They can focus on more complex issues.

- title: Registration
  text: The conversation registration feature summarizes a transcript of an ongoing
    discussion using an AI natural language model and in co-creation with the agent
    registers all information in your CRM system. Hereby, Ally determines the issue
    description and the resolution. Real-time summarisation solves the issue where
    a customer needs to repeat their query and other information when transferred
    from a voice assistant to an agent.

- title: Agent Assist
  text: 'When Ally is ‘listening in’ on the call and summarising in real time, it
    can also suggest possible answers to the agent; even linking back to relevant
    parts of an instruction manual or knowledge base in your backend. Customers and
    human agents both benefit from this ''whisper'' feature. For new employees, this
    reduces the need to learn lengthy company handbooks by heart – or frantically
    searching for the correct information while on the call. The consumer receives
    prompt, precise responses to their queries. '
