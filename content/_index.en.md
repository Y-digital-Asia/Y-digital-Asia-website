  Many organisations are under pressure to become more digital, but why? Digital transformation is surely not the objective, it is a means to an end. The reason why we invest in technology is the empowerment of humans. Empowerment means leaving the tedious and repetitive work to your trusted digital colleague. Empowerment means truly scalable self-service for your customers without compromising on the human touch. Empowerment means no barriers, black-boxes, or lock-in but open and auditable solutions.

  Beyond the buzzwords A.I., Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Knowledge Graphs provide the foundations for Empowerment, but the true power comes not from technology but by using the Human as the Blueprint.

    enough or lead you through dialogues that are irrelevant. Now new technology is
    available to not only be scalable but also customer friendly.\n "
