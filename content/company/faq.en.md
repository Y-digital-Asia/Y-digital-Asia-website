intro_text: The tech business is constantly evolving, and new innovations appear on
  a regular basis. Adapting to changes means gaining all the necessary information
  about artificial intelligence (AI). As experts in the field, we would like to contribute
  to spreading the knowledge about AI by answering a set of questions that are frequently
  asked.
q_and_a:
- question: What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
  answer: Artificial Intelligence are concepts and technologies that aim to enable
    computers to perform feats of human-like cognition. For Y.digital, core AI technologies
    include Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Knowledge Graphs.
- question: What is Natural Language Processing?
  answer: The goal of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is to enable computers to
    interpret text and spoken language in the same manner that humans can. Example
    applications include document classification, machine translation, speech processing,
    and topic extraction.
- question: What is Computer Vision?
  answer: Computer Vision is a collection of technologies aimed at allowing computers
    to process images and video. Example applications include object recognition,
    signature detection and recognition, and table recognition.
- question: What are Knowledge Graphs?
  answer: Knowledge Graphs are a natural, machine-interpretable way to express knowledge
    about the world. This knowledge is represented as an interconnected web of attributes,
    relationships, and values. Knowledge can be automatically distilled from data
    collections such as texts (e.g. laws and regulations, rules, regulations, work
    instructions, professional articles, disciplinary law, texts in deeds and statements,
    etc.), or structured data sources.
- question: What is Semantic Search?
  answer: Semantic Search helps users find relevant information in the ever-increasing
    amount of data available online or in a company’s internal repositories (e.g.,
    SharePoint, OneDrive, FileShares, document management systems, email). Semantic
    Search relies on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Graphs to go beyond
    literal matching, keyword-based search algorithms to unearth information that
    would otherwise be overlooked while avoiding clutter and irrelevant search results.
- question: What is Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)?
  answer: IDP helps businesses increase operational efficiency and productivity by
    streamlining their knowledge-intensive processes (e.g. desk & dossier-based work).
    IDP can significantly reduce the burden on knowledge workers by providing them
    with decision support on large volumes of dossiers or documents. Additionally,
    IDP helps to improve compliance, consistency, and data security by relieving human
    workers of time-consuming manual tasks, hence increasing employee engagement.
- question: What types of technologies are involved in IDP solutions?
  answer: Optical character recognition (OCR), Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language
    Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision are all part of a sophisticated IDP platform.
    It also employs AI components capable of analyzing both structured and unstructured
    data while continuously learning and increasing accuracy.
- question: Is IDP scalable?
  answer: IDP is scalable because it can process as many documents as needed without
    becoming overwhelmed. Every day, you can handle millions, if not billions, of
    data points. IDP is the solution if your company has seasons with a higher need
    for document processing. It grows in conjunction with your business.
- question: What is a Voice App?
  answer: A voice app is a voice-activated software that makes an organization accessible
    via, for example, the Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. The official term at Google
    is a Google Action, Amazon calls it a skill. Through a voice app, an organization
    gives the user the ability to communicate with the organization through the platforms
    of Google or Amazon.
- question: What is a Google Action?
  answer: A Google Action is an application on the Google Assistant. With Google Action,
    organizations can integrate their products, services, news, or entertainment with
    the Google Assistant. Think of Google Actions from Bol.com, the Hypotheker, or
    Racoon.
- question: Can you also use a voice assistant in a call center?
  answer: You can also use a voice assistant in your call center. We call this Smart
    Call Assistance. The customer can say what he is calling about in his own (natural)
    language, after which the voice assistant puts him through to the right department.
    Or he can give the correct answer himself, thus reducing waiting times. It also
    has a positive effect because waiting times shorten and the workload in the call
    center decreases.
- question: What is Voice Search?
  answer: Voice Search is searching for information using voice commands. Through
    the voice channel, users can make searches using their voice. To get information
    through Voice Search, a voice assistant and a device is needed. These include
    Google Assistant, Apple's Siri, or Amazon's Alexa.
- question: How does Voice Search work?
  answer: More and more users prefer speaking over typing when they enter a search
    query. This is called Voice Search. Google's algorithms then search for the best
    and fastest available answer. The top position is worth a lot here, especially
    since a voice assistant only gives one answer based on the search algorithm -
    this is particularly important for devices without a screen, like the Google Home
    or AirPods.
- question: What is Voice Marketing?
  answer: Voice marketing is serving users or customers through the channel of voice
    by making information, products, services, and entertainment accessible to the
    voice channel. As an example, you can optimize your website for Voice Search and
    develop Google Actions.
- question: How does my business get on the Google Assistant?
  answer: 'In order to make your business more discoverable on Google Assistant, you
    can do three things: First, create a Google My Business page. Then, make your
    website more findable by Voice Search and develop a Google Action. Lastly, you
    can, for instance, promote your company''s products or services in an Action.'
