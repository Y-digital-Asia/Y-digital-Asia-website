      ## The Role

      Our Digital Transformation Consultants work directly with high-profile organisations across different sectors (government, financial, utilities, health). You represent Y. Digital, our unique vision, approach, solutions, platform and showcases. You make our AI solutions tangible and understandable by giving presentations, inspiration sessions and facilitating design labs, to generate and prioritise valuable ideas, create roadmaps and develop prototypes in close cooperation with customers. You turn ideas into concrete projects, elaborating feasibility studies, business process designs, conversation designs, information and knowledge models. You lead the digital transformation project during design, development and implementation of the AI solution, using our agile approach, working in multi-disciplinary teams. You will work closely with our highly-skilled AI experts: a strong peer group of experienced machine learning engineers and data scientists. Within this role, as we are expanding and growing rapidly, there is ample room to develop, grow and achieve your personal goals and ambitions.

      ## Your Profile

      You have a passion to help people and organisations improve and transform. Your strength is connecting disciplines and building bridges between business and IT. You are enthusiastic, ambitious and you want to have impact. You have a broad inte- rest and a curiosity to understand each specific project and its challenges. You love co-creating with groups of people, providing inspiration, generating ideas, designing the desired way of working. You have a can-do mentality and are willing to take the lead. You are flexible, quickly adapting to the needs of each specific project. You are fascinated by AI and have a good understanding of the underlying concepts and technology and how this can be turned into AI-solutions. But don’t worry: no actual coding skills are needed, and we can fill any gaps in your knowledge of AI with our Y.academy during your first months.

      **For Mediors:** a typical profile would be a business analyst or consultant with hands-on experience in IT, or an IT professional with a desire switching your career towards business analysis and consultancy.
